#Supervised learning means to learn a mapping


from INPUTS/FEATURES to OUTPUTS/LABELS
discrimination != Classification != regression 

We have different models with different parameters

Typical metrics:
- Accuracy (classification)
- Mean Avg Error, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (regression)



#Unsupervised = learning structure directly from X data

Examples:
- clustering
- dimensionality reduction
- outlier detection
- time series/NLP/generative (prediction of next text token)
- RL (next move to win)

Typical diagnostics:
- Silhouette score (clustering)
- Explained Variance (dim. red.)
- Reconstruction error (outlier detection)
- reward/learning curves (RL)
